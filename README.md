<h2>Hey, I'm Saurabh 👋</h2>

**2x Founder** building products that solve real problems.

### What I'm Building

🏋️ **[Dizios](https://dizios.com)** — The AI fitness platform for studios, trainers, and the people they transform. Not another gym management tool. An operating system for the fitness industry.

🚀 **[Vikrama](https://vikrama.in)** — AI Systems & Growth Studio. We help businesses ship AI-first products, not PowerPoint strategies.

### The Stack I Ship With

```
Frontend    →  Next.js · React · Flutter · Tailwind
Backend     →  NestJS · Node.js · Prisma · PostgreSQL
AI / Data   →  LLM Integration · AI Agents · Prompt Engineering
Cloud       →  AWS · Firebase · Hostinger Cloud
Payments    →  Razorpay · UPI Integration
Tools       →  Claude Code · Git · Figma
```

### What I Believe

- Ship fast, learn faster. I built Dizios's entire backend (120+ APIs, 60+ models) and 3 apps in months — solo.
- AI isn't a feature. It's the product. Every tool I build has intelligence baked in from day one.
- India-first, global-ready. Building for ₹ before $.
